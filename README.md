# Flight_Fare_Prediction
### Flight Fare Prediction
### Problem Statement:
Travelling through flights has become an integral part of today’s lifestyle as more and more people are opting for faster travelling options. The flight ticket prices increase or decrease every now and then depending on various factors like timing of the flights, destination, and duration of flights various occasions such as vacations or festive season. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will surely help many people save money and time.
- Size of test set: 2671 records
- FEATURES: Airline: The name of the airline.
- Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey
- Source: The source from which the service begins.
- Destination: The destination where the service ends.
- Route: The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.
- Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.
- Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.
- Duration: Total duration of the flight.
- Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination.
- Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight
- Price: The price of the ticket

### Approach: 
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

### Cleaning the Data
I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

Made Columns for Day and Month out of Date of Journey
Calculated the total flight duration
Removed the null values
Removed the outliers
